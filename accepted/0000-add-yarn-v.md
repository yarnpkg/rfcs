- Yarn Issue:

# Summary

Add `yarn -v` command

# Motivation

When i type in console `yarn -v` I expect to see installed version of yarn (like with `yarn --version`), as in most of other command applications. Instead, as I understood, if command not determined, yarn runs `yarn install`.

# Drawbacks

May be some restrictions, to implement this feature.
