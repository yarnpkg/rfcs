# Summary

Fun command to wish the user of yarn on xmas.

# Motivation

`npm xmas` displays something like:

```
                     ★
                    ／＼

npm loves you Happy Xmas, Noders!
```

It would be fun to have `yarn xmas` to display something similar or even better some text animation?

# Detailed design

Could be something very similar to [npm#xmas.js](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/lib/xmas.js)

# How We Teach This

No overhead as such, just let them enjoy `yarn xams`.

# Drawbacks

None.

# Alternatives

More aliases for xmas?

# Unresolved questions

None.
